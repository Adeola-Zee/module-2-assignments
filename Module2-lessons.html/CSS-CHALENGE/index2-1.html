        <h3>The giraffe is an African mammal.</h3><br>
        
        It is the <em>tallest</em> living terrestrial animal and the <strong>largest ruminant</strong> on Earth.<br>

        The giraffe's distinguishing characteristics are;<br>
        <strong><em>its extremely long neck and legs,</em> its horn-like ossicones and its spotted coat patterns.</strong><br>
             
         Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands.<br>

         They exist in scattered range extending from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south,<br>
         and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east.<br>

         Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants;<br>
         primarily acacia species which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.
