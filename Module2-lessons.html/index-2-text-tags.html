    <h1>TEXT TAGS Challenge</h1>
    <p>
        Nobody’s born smart. <strong>We all start at 0. <em>Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra</em>.</strong> <br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</em><br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs <em>just like the rest of us.</em><br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        <strong>Until one day, <em>you walk.</em></strong><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <em>This. is. learning.</em><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You <em>just</em> don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</em><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn <em>anything.</em></strong>
